# UCLC1008 — Gen AI agent showcase (student support)

This folder contains **selected materials** from the UCLC1008 (University English I) course to showcase how a **Gen AI agent** may help students with academic reading and writing.

## Contents

### `lessonsMoodle/`
- **Mat/** — Sample AWQ (Student) in Markdown: Articles A & B (Hong et al., Andrejevic & Selwyn) on FRT in schools; instructions and rubric context.
- **Plans/** — Lesson plans (week3–week6): synthesis, argumentation, AWQ practice, in-class quiz prep. An agent can help students understand task structure and rubric alignment.
- **Moodle_posts/week3/** — Week 3 forum tasks (HTML): title analysis, abstract structure, purpose statement, section headings, topic sentences; paraphrasing, avoiding plagiarism, summarising, no personal bias, main-idea coverage. Examples of tasks an agent could support (e.g. clarifying instructions, checking drafts against criteria).

### `materials/`
- **course materials in MD/** — Module 1 (components of academic articles), Module 2 (paraphrasing, summarising, synthesising); Study Guide to Academic Writing Quiz; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions; Sample AWQ and Student Answer. Core reading an agent can reference when helping students.
- **Week1-5_AWQ/** — AWQ preparation plans (planAWQ.md, plan15.md, week3.md). Shows how lessons build toward the in-class Academic Writing Quiz.

## How a Gen AI agent may help students

- **Understanding tasks:** Use plans and Moodle task HTML to explain what is required (e.g. “synthesise both sources,” “no personal bias,” “APA citations”).
- **Using rubrics:** Refer to AWQ rubric (Summary Accuracy, Synthesis, Paraphrasing, Academic Tone, In-text Citations) when reviewing drafts or self-checking.
- **Drafting and revising:** Use Module 1 & 2 and Sample AWQ to suggest structure (thesis, topic sentences, conclusion), paraphrasing, and synthesis language (“In contrast,” “Whereas”).
- **Practice:** Point students to relevant Moodle tasks and materials (e.g. Week 3 tasks, Study Guide to AWQ) for targeted practice.
