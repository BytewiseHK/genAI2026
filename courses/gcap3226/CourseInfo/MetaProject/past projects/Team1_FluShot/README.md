- **Data requirements:** CHP, HA, Census — surveillance, demographics, vaccination, environmental data for regression or simulation.
- **School vaccination report card:** Regression of URTI absenteeism on vaccination rate; leaderboard and "Protection Score"; accountability (EDB, SDA, principal appraisal).
- **Vaccine effectiveness:** Test-negative design using eHealth-verified vaccination and lab results.
- **Report structure:** Report card + VE + data governance gap analysis.
