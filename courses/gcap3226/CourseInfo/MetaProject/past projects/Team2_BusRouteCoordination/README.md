# Team 2: Bus Route Coordination — Past Project (Fall 2025)

**Course Portal:** [GCAP 3226 Fall 2025 — Bus Route](https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/fall-2025/team/bus-route)

---

## Overview

This past project analyzes and improves **bus route coordination** in Hong Kong through data-driven policy analysis, API data collection, and government engagement. It corresponds to **Team 2: Bus Route Coordination** from GCAP 3226 Fall 2025. Related Spring 2026 topic: **Bus Stop Merge** (Group 7).

---

## Core research question

**To what extent does the Hong Kong Transport Department use data-driven approaches in bus route placement, merging decisions, and urban transportation optimization?**

Focus areas: overlapping routes (KMB 272A, Citybus 582); coordination between operators; passenger waiting times; API data; government engagement (TD, 1823).

---

## What the team did

- **Government engagement:** TD reply via 1823 (Dec 2025): Government not willing to follow up on route coordination/merger; routes serve different functions and passenger groups. Next step: LegCo report.
- **API data:** Hong Kong Government Open Data APIs; route overlap analysis; coordination data.
- **Email drafts:** Bus operators, Transport Department; Code on Access to Information.
- **Mathematical models:** Topic3_BusRoutesCoordination_MathModels; spatial optimization; passenger flow.
- **Report structure:** API data → TD process → placement principles → mathematical models → recommendations.

## Government engagement status (Dec 2025)

- **TD reply (1823):** Government not willing to follow up on route coordination/merger.
- **Reasoning:** Routes (KMB 272A, Citybus 582) serve different functions and passenger groups.
- **Next step:** Prepare LegCo report to escalate the issue.
